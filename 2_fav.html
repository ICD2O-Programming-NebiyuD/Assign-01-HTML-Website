			<p>LeBron was selected as the #1 overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers straight out of high school. The expectations were sky-high, but he quickly lived up to the hype. In his rookie season, he was named NBA Rookie of the Year and became an instant star. Over the next few years, he grew into the face of the franchise and one of the best players in the league.

By 2009 and 2010, LeBron had already won two MVPs and led the Cavaliers to the best record in the NBA in both seasons. During this stretch, he became known for his all-around game — elite scoring, playmaking, rebounding, and defense.

Despite his individual success, LeBron couldn’t get over the hump in the playoffs, with Cleveland falling short in the 2007 NBA Finals (losing to the San Antonio Spurs in four games) and facing early playoff exits in the following years. In 2010, after a disappointing playoff loss to the Boston Celtics, LeBron made the controversial decision to leave Cleveland and join the Miami Heat in free agency.</p>
